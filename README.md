# fibaconn

A project for Firebase projects testing
By Devoskropic through 207 Labz

## Getting Started -Notes- [^1].

On past projects ( wbsports and authapp) I've been learning on how to use Authentication plugin (firebase_auth), now is the turn to keep using it and expand to others.

Quick start guide: [non-official starting guide](https://medium.com/@rehmaankhan287/how-to-configure-your-flutter-app-with-firebase-using-firebase-cli-eca42248ae92)

Before implementing firebase plugins, I'll make the app a bit bigger, in this case I'm going to implement the google codelab related to the first flutter application, but instead of making it for desktop, I'll do it for cellphones and of course not following exactly the tutorial, but adding some more stuff.
